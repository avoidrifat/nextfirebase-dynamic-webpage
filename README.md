# Next.Js Dynamic Web Template Website with Tailwind CSS & Firebase


### Flexibility meets convenience in web template customization:

A dynamic website template using Next.js, Tailwind CSS,
and Firebase. The template includes multiple pages, such as the
homepage, contact page, about us page, and services page, all of
which can be edited through an admin page. Authentication is
implemented using Firebase, allowing the admin to log in securely.
The admin can update text and images on each page, leveraging the
CRUD functionality provided by Firebase. The changes made
dynamically update the corresponding web pages, creating a flexible
and customizable website template.
